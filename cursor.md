This is an in-progress project to make puzzle construction software for "Minesweeper Sudoku" aka "Sudoku Mine".  My version is to be called "Lime Sudoku", as the
landmines will be visually replaced by lime wedges.

The puzzle is a cross between Minesweeper and Sudoku.  It is played on a 9x9 Sudoku grid.  Each container in the puzzle (row, column, 3x3 block) contains 3 hidden limes.
The clues in the puzzle indicate how many limes are adjacent (horizontally, vertically or diagonally) the cell with the clue.
